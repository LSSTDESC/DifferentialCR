dcr_utils.py is all the code that I used to make each plot.

filter_files is a directory with all the filters that I manually call in my code (might be
Different when you use MAF)

airmass.ipnyb is a neat python notebook that Sid gave me to use the cursor to select visits from a specific database.

maf-egfootprint-example.html is a python tutorial to applying the cosmology cuts provided by Humna

quick_example contains an example of when I used the MAF to apply cosmology cuts and looked at the ellipticity quantiles at each filter. This uses a lot of functions in dcr_utils and I thought it would be helpful to incorporate.
